# 6. Three-tree architecture 


1. The 3 tree are ***working***, ***staging-index***, ***repository*** respectively.
2. From ***working*** to ***staging-index***
	* `git add README.md`
3. From ***staging-index*** to ***repository***
	* `git commit README.mdt`
4. Back from ***respository*** to ***working***, use `pull`. This process will automatically update ***staging-index***. This is a one-step process.  

	We do this to remove all the changes we made at ***working***
