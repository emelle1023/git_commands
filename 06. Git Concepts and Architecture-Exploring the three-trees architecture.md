# 6. Exploring the three-trees architecture (Optional)



## Three-tree architecture
* The 3 tree are
	* `repository`
	* `staging index`
	* `working`
* From `working` to `staging index`, use `add`
	* For example: `git add file.txt`
* From `staging index` to `repository`, use `commit`
	* For example: `git commit file.txt`
* We can also `pull` from `respository` to `working`. This process will also update `staging index`. This is a one-step process.
