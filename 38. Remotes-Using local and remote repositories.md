# 38. Using local and remote repositories

## 38.1 `push`
* `add` &#8594; stages files from `working directory` to `staging index`.
* `commit` &#8594; commits files from `staging index` to `local repository`.
* `push` &#8594; clones a branch (master branch) from `local repository` and paste it in `remote repository` for others to see.
* `push` &#8594; at the same time, creates another branch called `origin/<branch>` (`origin/master`) in `local repository`. `origin/master` is a branch on our local machine that references the remote server branch. It always tries to stay in sync.

* `push` the code to `remote server`.

## 38.2 `fetch`
* `fetch` &#8594; retrieves from `remote repository` to `local repository`.
* `fetch` &#8594; syncs up what is in `remote repository` reflected in `origin/master`. However, it won't bring the change into the `master` branch.

* master in remote server and origin/mastare are in sync.
* There is a conflicts between origin/master and master in my computer.
