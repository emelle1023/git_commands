# 9. The HEAD pointer

* **HEAD** pointer always points to a *tip* of the current branch in ***respostory***, not ***staging-index*** or ***working***. 
* In another word, **HEAD** points to the last commit. 
* **HEAD** is the most updated version that you are happy with as you have committed it.
* Each branch would have its own **HEAD** pointer. Every time we switch branch, **HEAD** will point to the *tip* of that branch. More of this later.

## To keep track of **HEAD**

1. `cd GIT_PROJECT/.git` - (Look for a HEAD file)
2. `cat HEAD` - (shows it is pointing a master under refs folder)
	* if we get `ref: refs/heads/master`  	
3. `cat GIT_PROJECT/.git/refs/heads/master` - (shows you a SHA)
	* `7aa195bcd10758a1fcac8034a557f0816`
4. `git log` - (you will see the SHA, which has all of your latest commit at ***respository***)
