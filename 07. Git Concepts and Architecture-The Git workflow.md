# 7. Git workflow

We have covered the commands and this is more like a demonstration.

## 7.1 First  
The workflow consists of these steps.

1. `vim file.txt` - (Create a new file)
2. `git add file.txt` - (Add file to ***staging***)
3. `git commit -m "Create new file"` - (Commit file to ***respository***)

Now, ***working***, ***staging-index***, ***respository*** all have the same version of `file.txt`. 

## 7.2 Second
We will continue to work on `file.txt`

1. `vim file.txt` - (Edit the file)
2. `git add file.txt` - (Add the newer version file to ***staging***)
3. `git commit -m "New version of file"` - (Commit newer version file to ***respository***)

Now, ***working***, ***staging-index***, ***respository*** all have the same NEWER version of `file.txt`.

## 7.3 Third
We should confirm by checking history

* `git log`

## 7.4 Notes
Repeat these steps whenever you have edited or created a file.
